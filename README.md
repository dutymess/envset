## Introcuction

This is a super easy microservice to set an `.env` variable in a standard Laravel project. 

```bash
./envSet DB_DATABASE blog
```

## Optimized?

Not really!

The whole thing is made overnight, on the first day of getting familiar with `GO` programming language. 

I'll improve it though.
